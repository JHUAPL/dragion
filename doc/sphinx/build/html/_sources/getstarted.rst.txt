Dependencies
------------

VTK
^^^^^^^

You will need to compile [VTK 8.2](vtk.org/download) from source, with Java bindings enabled. Typically on MacOS or Linux, using [CMake](https://cmake.org/), this looks like::

	wget https://www.vtk.org/files/release/8.2/VTK-8.2.0.tar.gz
	tar xf VTK-8.2.0.tar.gz
	cd VTK-8.2.0
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$VTK_HOME -DVTK_WRAP_JAVA=TRUE ..
	make install

Note that ``$VTK_HOME`` must be defined prior to invocation of cmake. The VTK Java bindings jar-file ``vtk.jar`` and a multitude of dynamically linked sub-libraries are installed into ``$VTK_HOME/lib``.

mowgli
^^^^^^

Implementation of surfaces, distribution samplers, and other low-level building blocks are currently part of the **mowgli** library. Clone it from <http://hardin.jhuapl.edu:8080/scm/zimmemi1/mowgli>. Further documentation can be found *here*.

lestat
^^^^^^

TODO: copy from lestat getting-started docs

Installation and test run
-------------------------

Get the code from <http://hardin.jhuapl.edu:8080/scm/zimmemi1/dragion>. Assume that it is cloned into `~/dragion`.

For now the classpath and runtime library path are passed explicitly to the JRE from the command line (this will probably chang>

To print a helpful message, try::

        DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/local/vtk-8.2/lib \
        java -Djava.library.path=/Users/zimmemi1/local/vtk-8.2/lib \
        -classpath ~/dragion/bin:~/dragion/lib/commons-math3-3.6.1/commons-math3-3.6.1.jar:~/dragion/lib/guava-28.1/guava-28.1->
        dragion.Main
